						Introduction
					</HeaderWrapper>
					<BodyWrapper>
						This project is a recreation of the Game of Life with a mix of C and ARM assembly language as practice.
						Basically all the logics such as updating the board is written in ARM but all the interface is written in C.
						This is a simulation on command line.

						Main
					</HeaderWrapper>
					<BodyWrapper>
						This is simulation has the same rule set as John Conway's Game of Life: <br/>
						Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.<br/>
						Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.<br/>
						Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.<br/>
						Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.<br/>

						Demo: (to be added). Email me for the code.
